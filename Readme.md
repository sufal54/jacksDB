# ðŸ§© JacksDB â€“ Encrypted JSON Document Database

**JacksDB** is a secure, local-first, file-based document database built in TypeScript. It uses AES-256-CBC encryption, per-field indexing (including nested fields), and MongoDB-style APIs for inserting, querying, updating, and deleting documents â€” all from the filesystem, with no external dependencies.
